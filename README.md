# Problem Statement
The UN Aid Hub app is designed to help deliver aid to refugees in cities affected by war. Challenges include difficulty accessing aid because of ongoing conflict and damaged infrastructure. Coordinating efforts among different organizations and ensuring donors' trust are also major issues. Providing real-time updates on conflicts is crucial due to their severity, emphasizing the urgent need for effective humanitarian aid.

# Our Primary Focus
Our primary focus lies in overcoming key hurdles:

- Access to Aid 
War-torn cities present formidable obstacles to accessing vital aid due to ongoing conflict, infrastructure destruction, and limited resources, hindering the delivery of essential supplies such as food, water, shelter, and medical assistance.

- Coordination of Efforts 
Effective humanitarian aid necessitates seamless coordination among diverse organizations, encompassing UN-affiliated agencies and reputable NGOs operating within the region, to maximize impact and prevent resource duplication.

- Trustworthiness of Organizations 
Donors seek assurance that their contributions are effectively utilized. Identifying dependable organizations with a proven track record of responsible aid delivery is crucial to instill confidence among donors.

Through real-time updates and comprehensive coverage, we aim to raise awareness, mobilize support, and ensure timely responses to evolving humanitarian crises. The provided data underscores the urgency of effective humanitarian intervention to alleviate suffering and promote peace and stability in conflict-affected regions.
